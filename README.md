Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software enginering is an engineering principle that involves methods and tools to design,develop,test ,deploy and maintain high quality software systems.
Software enginering has been of great impact to the industry through  the development of systems that advance various aspects of the modern life such as healthcare,communication and ecommerce sectors.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The key milestone are :
the development of programming languages such as C in the 1940s.
the Software engineeering principle was introduced in the 1960s this marked the software engineering as a displine in the engineering field and it brough about the need to develop more software based solutions
The establishment of strauctured programming language in 1970s .The languages such as C were used by then programmers to write codes  that were highly maintainable  and  easily readable.
in the 2000s there was the emergence of different methodologies such as the agile that made it easy for the developers to work on the solutions in collaboration with the users insights this led to the development of more flexible software that the requirements can easily be adopted based on the user needs.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Requirements gathering:Gather the needed requirements from the user and do a proper documentation.
Design-This invoves comming up with the architectural design of the product and the user interface.
Implementation-Involves writing codes to actualize the the deisgned solution.
Testing-Involves carrying out various testing of the product to ensure they meet a quality standard.
Deployment-This stage involves releasing the software to the users or customers.
Maintenance-This involves offering continued support as the software is being used such as carrying out updates on various features.



Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodlogy makes use of the sequential approach whereby a phase has to be completed in order to move to the next.Once a phase is completed it is difficult to make changes on the previous phase.Waterfall method is better applied on small scale projects whose requirements are well defined and are not expected to change. On the other hand Agile methodology makes use of an iterative approach where by a module is developed tested and deployed on each cycle focusing on collaboration and responding to change.This is best for large and complex systems whose requirements keep on changing over time as its easier to make changes when needed.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A software developer writes codes and implements software solutions.
A quality Assurance Engineer carries out testing of the software to ensure it meets the required quality.
A project Manager oversees the planning,execution and deliverying of a software solution.
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs such as visual studio code,netbeans and VCS such as git enhance productivity,collaboration and good code quality IDEs give developers features to write,test and debbug code and VCs enable developers to easily track the code and collaborate with other team members. 

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Some of the challenges faced by software engineers include tight deadlines,changing of the requirements during development and technical debt.In order to reslove the challenges the use of agile methodology can save on the changing requirements as it will not affect the whole system.Its is impoetant to keep on checking on the project timelines to avoid strict deadlines.Priotization of tasks can also help in meeting the deadlines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing involves the testing of individual modules.
Intergration testing involves the testing of integration between different components in the system.
System testing involves testing a sytem as a whole.
Acceptance testing involves making tests based on the user requirements to meet user needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering
Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is a practise of making sure the prompt made to an AI correctly fits your problem or rather structure a query in a way that suits the context.Prompt engineering is important when interacting with AI as it optimizes the AI in generating the desired responses.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
vague prompt:"Explain artificial intelligence"
improved prompt:"Explain Artificial intelligence in a manner that a five year old kid  can clearly understand"
